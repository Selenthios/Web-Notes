Javascript Lecture:

-- Fast and good Javascript is necessary for clients

-- Javascript Server Side -- Node.js
-- Let's say you want to focus on a username field. What would the code look like? This is an example used:
<script>

    if (document.forms.login.username.value === '')
    {
      document.forms.login.username.focus();
    }
    else 
    {
      document.forms.login.password.focus();
    }
</script>
