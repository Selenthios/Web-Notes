Jen Simmons -- Design, Message, Look

++ *{Box-sizing: Border-box} -- Creates a box of with the actual size you want it (makes floating content easier)
-- Make your own framework using code from other frameworks
-- Guide the reader and use negative space as a map


    -- Useful tools coming or here:
        -- Initial Letter
        ++ @supports wrapped around whatever doesn't work will check to see if the entire thing works. If not it backs out (this is called a feature query)
        ++ display: flex and margin: auto will change viewport (look into using vh, vw, vmin, vmax)
        ++ object fit changes size of image and crops it according to viewport size (object-fit: cover)
        -- clip-path will chop the edge of box off to make the image more unique and not as flat
        ++ shape-outside will flow conent around the image (labs.jensimmons has an arrow tool) [CSS Shapes Editor Plug in as well]
        ++ Float drop problem can be solved in a much better way using Flexbox/CSS Grid. You can cap height to or width to all make it change according to browser and float a lot better
        ++ Multicolumn will switch images into better columns for image with set width
        ++ grid-auto-flow: dense makes different groups fit where it can depending on where they will fit.
        -- Firefox Nightly is a browser most up to date with CSS implementation
        -- CSS Grid Inspector is an add on to check out how it all works
        
We as an industry need to come out with unique and well thought out designs. Web and it's recent predictability should change.
