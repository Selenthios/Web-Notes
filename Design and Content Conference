++ *{Box-sizing: Border-box} -- Creates a box of with the actual size you want it (makes floating content easier)
-- Make your own framework using code from other frameworks
-- Guide the reader and use negative space as a map


    -- Useful tools coming or here:
        -- Initial Letter
        ++ @supports wrapped around whatever doesn't work will check to see if the entire thing works. If not it backs out (this is called a feature query)
        ++ display: flex and margin: auto will change viewport (look into using vh, vw, vmin, vmax)
        ++ object fit changes size of image and crops it according to viewport size (object-fit: cover)
        -- clip-path will chop the edge of box off to make the image more unique and not as flat
        ++ shape-outside will flow conent around the image (labs.jensimmons has an arrow tool) [CSS Shapes Editor Plug in as well]
